# Statsify Overlay Revival Project

Welcome to the Statsify Overlay Revival Project! This project aims to revive and improve the Statsify Overlay, originally developed in Electron, by porting it to Tauri for better performance and efficiency.

## About Statsify Overlay

Statsify Overlay is a tool designed to display player statistics within the game environment, particularly for Hypixel Minecraft servers. This overlay provides real-time information about players' performance, such as kill count, deaths, win rate, and more.

## Why Tauri?

The project is being ported to Tauri from Electron for several reasons:

1. **Performance:** Tauri offers significant performance improvements compared to Electron, resulting in a smoother and more responsive user experience.

2. **Efficiency:** Tauri provides a lightweight alternative to Electron, reducing the overhead and resource usage of the application.

3. **Modern Development:** Tauri leverages modern web technologies and frameworks, making it easier to develop and maintain the project over time.

## Why port in the first place?
Personally, Statsify Overlay was the overlay I used since I started grinding years ago. I don't care if it doesn't have the latest 'AntiSniper' functionality or what have you, but I love this overlay. Why go through this? I want to use this app for myself.
